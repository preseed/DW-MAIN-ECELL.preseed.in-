<p>Dealflow is not about floating some deal to an investor like a broker. It is about being able to tell your story better than you can. I mean you can blow your own trumpet, but understand the difference between you blowing your own trumpet. Furthermore, understand the difference between anyone else blowing your trumpet and us blowing your trumpet. Dealflow is about story telling of your brand to be. It is not just for the investors but also for your teams. It is that which creates a possibility of ‘inspiration’ for your business. Inspiration because when we evangelise, we don’t just sell, we inspire. <br>
Your measure of on boarding us, must be, in your ability to gauge if we can be the best story tellers you can have, such that, even in your absence your story is not only told, but also heard with awe and inspiration. At this stage of your startup, your story will sell better than your status quo. </p>
<br>
<b>How do we understand your story?</b>
<br>
<p>
We spend countless hours in conversations with you, recording those conversations, editing them wherever necessary to send it to the network of our mentors to hear it to improve it and then training you to internalise it as not just your story but now a collective story of you and Preseed team together in context to your business. It is in this story that the face value of your team gets the face value of our team too. It is in this story that you ultimately raise money, repeatedly. It’s not a one time act. It is in this story that we on-board people for your team whenever we find one. It is in this story that our team and your team get synchronised, (or any team, because we tell it so) as if one. </p>
<br>
<p>
For doing so, we take an upfront minimum equity. This is the only reason why we would invest our time and energy on your startup. <b>Even listening to your story, your pains, your business or your dream, will cost us time and money; with effect from now.</b> We will charge for it upfront. 
<br>
Step 1 - Please <a href="https://medium.com/the-preseed/tagged/contracts" target="_blank">dig the termsheets</a> on our medium essays to understand the terms. 
<br>
Step 2 - Copy and paste them, sign them and send to us. 
<br>
Our contracts are non negotiable in nature. They are standards we follow with every startup.

			Additionally from whatever you have read at <a href="http://nishchal.preseed.in/" target="_blank">nishchal.preseed.in</a> I am building Preseed Ecell. Here E stands for Education and Entrepreneurship. For all that should have been taught to children before they turn 18. Because what they learn becomes the future of our country. We want to run it as a modern ashram for students and entrepreneurs. One day we hope to serve India by making Preseed Ecell become home to deserving students and innovators.</p>

<b>Here we educate you on the new age way of building a tech startup through marketing.</b>
A school in delhi to educate those entrepreneurial spirited students who are forced to chase a recognised education degree by their parents instead of building something. So we decided to give them a degree that can further their cause, without them having to rebel against their parents.
<br></br>
<b>Delhi Startup School:</b> This is what we are going to call it.
<br></br>
Guiding Principle -: All it takes is, being forever ready to reach out to anyone in the world through the internet.
<br></br>
Over the last 10 years in Delhi I have come to realise that the culture of entrepreneurship, even though is on the rise, still doesn’t educate on the essence of simplicity, bootstrapping and quick launch.
<br></br>
Anyway, that being the broader life skill we wan’t be able to conclusively impart by running a programme -:
<br></br>
<a href="https://medium.com/preseed-web-lab/c68fd5dacc51" target="_blank"><h4>‘Marketing Precedes Coding’</h4></a>
<br>
(Do read the article linked with this heading). Some of the points of training students in this specific field is that -:
<br></br>
1. Hackers can be found because hackers have enough tools on the web to learn hacking from like on mentioned on this kippt list and enough platforms to shoot their queries to, to feed on their curiosity. Moreover there are many programmes to train people in programing.<br>
2. Designers are those who are artists in their soul anyway. They will figure their route to becoming designers anyway. They too have too many schools, programmes and online tools to begin with.<br>
3. Hustler — This guy is the guy who is enterprising enough to go out there on the ground and connect the dots. One of his main jobs is to be able to <b>market the idea</b> that he is going out there to create. <b>We want to train this guy over how marketing is done in this new age way even prior to the product is built.</b><br>
4. Above all, this is the chance for graduates to get in tune with the world their colleges never taught them about. The world of building startups.<br></br>
So clearly this programme is for those who are specifically interested in learning digital marketing for the purpose of product launches. For these guys truly understand the importance of being able to launch their future idea even if there was little to no money to doing so.
<br></br>
We will essentially teach you about distribution of web and mobile apps through educating you over -:
<br></br>
1. How were some of the most extraordinary companies built?<br>
2. What does the contemporary startup ecosystem of the world look like after the creation of products like Angellist?<br>
3. What is a good idea?<br>
4. The tools that empower us in building a company.<br>
5. Above all, the new age ways of marketing because the web has become extremely social, thus, changing the landscape of past ways of marketing still being taught in a lot of MBA Schools.<br>
6. Above all we will teach you how to use the internet to learn.<br></br>
<b>We will train you over a period of 1 year and give you a degree in Masters in Entrepreneurship.</b> We will put you through real job scenarios to give you good insights into what it takes to really build something from technology to design.
<br></br>
Above all we would impart in you the culture Preseed is being built upon. In doing so every member of the Preseed team will come forward to teaching you a thing or two. <b>Hence, every one from the <a href="http://preseed.in/team" target="_blank">Preseed Team</a> is a mentor here. These are the men you could learn from apart from our own set of educators hand picked from the industry.</b>
<br></br>
Yes, we will give you a UGC recognized degree in Masters in Entrepreneurship too. However, if you are really coming to us so that you could startup your own business really really soon, you will never have to need your degree certificate.
<br></br>
The fees of the Programme is Rs. 1, 50, 000 per year.
<br></br>
I hope -:
<br></br>
I hope you understand we are training you not only for your job as a marketer at a good tech startup, but to help you build one yourself someday.
<br></br>
I hope you also realise that if you are neither a designer nor a hacker and you still want to be able to be a co founder in a tech startup right from it’s day 1, you need to be the guy who can prelaunch it for customer validation the moment your product’s 1st version is ready. This is the gap you will fill in the team of 2 people, one hacker and one designer, building a product.
<br></br>
However if you are designer or a hacker, and yet wish to learn to distribute tech products on the web, please join in. You will learn a lot beyond your current skills.
<br></br>

			<h2>Usability</h2>
			<p  style="font-size: 17px;">After vision this is where we spend most of our time. We keep it to what's needed and where it's needed. Nothing that is not needed will ever find its way into our products.</p>
			<p  style="font-size: 17px;">Design is more important than engineering in the consumer web space. One of the problems we see in this space in India is not of that of engineering. In fact India produces strong engineers. It's a problem of design, for India seriously lacks consumer web 'design' sensibilities. The reason stands - lack of geeks here marrying some seriously cool people. We hope that someday we are able to teach that to India through our products.</p>

				<p class="lead">"Usability and the utility, not the visual design, determine the success or failure of a web-app. Since the visitor of the page is the only person who clicks the mouse and therefore decides everything, user-centric design has become a standard approach for successful and profit-oriented web design. After all, if users can’t use a feature, it might as well not exist." -

		<div class="span6 black_color_text">
			<h2>Lean</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 16px;">We take it a step further. Lean is how we
				<strong>live</strong>, let alone build stuff. We
				<em>'build, measure, learn, repeat'</em>and never raise funds without setting it right.</p>
					<p style="font-size: 16px;">Bootstrapping has its own entrepreneurial lessons that cannot be learnt without self experiencing them. We iterate, customer validate and reiterate. If we fail, we also fail fast, we re-iterate even faster and all of that, at minimum cost implications. In short we make sure we customer validate the products before we look to move to the next steps of development.
						<em>Shit gets done in least amounts of not only money but also time.</em>
